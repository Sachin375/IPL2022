          <h2>Indian Premier League</h2>
          <p style={{padding: "10px 150px", textAlign:"left"}}>The Indian Premier League (IPL), also officially known as TATA IPL for sponsorship reasons, is a professional men's Twenty20 cricket league, contested by ten teams based out of seven Indian cities and three Indian states. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007. It is usually held between March and May of every year and has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme</p>
          <p style={{padding: "10px 150px", textAlign:"left"}}>The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and in 2014 was ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues. In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the world to be broadcast live on YouTube. The brand value of the IPL in 2019 was ₹47,500 crore (US$6.2 billion), according to Duff & Phelps. According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$150 million) to the GDP of the Indian economy. The 2020 IPL season set a massive viewership record with 31.57 million average impressions and with an overall consumption increase of 23 per cent from the 2019 season</p>
          <p style={{padding: "10px 150px", textAlign:"left"}}>On 13 September 2007,[13] on the back of India's victory at the 2007 T20 World Cup,[14] BCCI announced a franchise-based Twenty20 cricket competition called Indian Premier League. The first season was slated to start in April 2008, in a "high-profile ceremony" in New Delhi. BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi, who spearheaded the IPL effort, spelled out the details of the tournament including its format, the prize money, franchise revenue system and squad composition rules. It was also revealed that the IPL would be run by a seven-man governing council composed of former India players and BCCI officials and that the top two teams of the IPL would qualify for that year's Champions League Twenty20. Modi also clarified that they had been working on the idea for two years and that the IPL was not started as a "knee-jerk reaction" to the ICL.[13] The league's format was similar to that of the Premier League of England and the NBA in the United States.</p>
